# Todo CLI App
A simple command-line todo application built with Node.js. 
It allows you to add, view, and remove tasks interactively using the terminal.

## Features
- Add a new task
- View all tasks
- Remove the last task
- Exit the application

## How It Works
The app uses Node.js's built-in `readline` module to interact with users via the terminal. All tasks are stored in memory while the app is running.


4. Follow the on-screen menu to manage your tasks.

## Example Menu
```
 1: Add a task
 2: View  tasks
 3: pop task
 4: exit
choose and option: 
```
